Two files are provided to make a complete AALSDK distribution,
reflecting the different licenses of the various parts.

  *.BSD-License.tar.gz
  *.Dual-BSD-GPLv2-License.tar.gz

They are distributed separately only to demonstrate that the sets of
files are governed by distinct and separate licenses.

Once you have all files, unpack them in the same directory. Once unpacked,
there will be a single directory that contains all of the files
that are needed.

If you redistribute the files, you do not need to keep them separated
as they were provided to you.

Documentation is provided in a separate tar file.
