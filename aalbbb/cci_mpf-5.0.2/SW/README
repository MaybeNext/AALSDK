Memory Property Factory - Virtual-to-Physical shim SW service (VTP service)
===========================================================================

The AAL VTP service allows other applications and services to establish shared
memory buffers with an AFU that can be addressed using virtual addresses. The
VTP service handles initialization of the VTP hardware shim and the creation and
maintenance of a page table to resolve virtual-to-physical address translations.


Build instructions
------------------

The VTP service (or VTP, for short) is a regular AAL service, and is built using
the AALSDK into a dynamic library that can be loaded an runtime when allocating
VTP.

The easiest way to create this library is by using the supplied Makefile. After
you have installed the AALSDK (see the AALSDK installation guide for details),
build VTP as follows:

   $ cd SW
   $ make prefix=<my_prefix>   # or make DESTDIR=<my_destdir>

Which variation of the make command you use depends on how you built and
installed the AALSDK.

The make step should leave you with the following files:

   libVTP.so.x.y.z
   libVTP.so         # link to libVTP.so.x.y.z
   libVTP.so.x       # link to libVTP.so.x.y.z

where x/y/z are set according to the version of VTP you have built. 



How to use VTP in your software application or service
------------------------------------------------------

VTP makes use of the existing ALI interface for MMIO and memory allocation
services provided by AAL, and as such does not interface with hardware directly.
Such a service is sometimes referred to as a "software-only" service - do not
let this terminology confuse you; VTP requires the VTP shim in hardware to
enable address translations.

VTP implements the IVTP interface defined in SW/include/aalsdk/service/IVTP.h.
