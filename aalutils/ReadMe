pciutils is the 3.4.0 stable version of pciutils, ~2015.10.30, available from
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/pciutils/pciutils.git

It contains README with various configuration options, but basically, in order
to use it, you want to use the following combination:
$ cd pciutils
$ make SHARED=yes
$ make PREFIX=<installation_directory> install-libs

It is not standard autoconf, but has some relationship with it.

fdebug is a user-mode debugging library that provides access to mmio spaces
and huge tbl pages.

Using /proc
	$ 'cat /proc/meminfo' to see HugePages information
	$ 'cat /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages' to the number of huge pages
	$ 'sudo echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages' to allocate 5 huge pages
	NOTE: on openSUSE 13.1 I had to actually 'sudo su -' to gain sufficient
		permissions to do the 'echo 5 > nr_hugepages'

Using /sys/kenel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-${size}kB
	$ 'cat nr_hugepages'
